# RISC-V-Reference-SOC-Tapeout-Program

This repository documents my learning journey and weekly progress through the comprehensive RISC-V Reference SOC Tapeout Program.

About the Program
This intensive program, conducted by VSD (VLSI System Design), provides hands-on training on designing a complete System on Chip (SoC) based on the open-source RISC-V architecture. The curriculum covers the entire RTL to GDSII flow, from high-level specification and RTL design to the final tapeout-ready physical layout.

My Weekly Progress üöÄ
I will be uploading my work to this repository on a weekly basis. Each folder will contain the assignments, projects, and learnings for that specific week of the program.
Week 0: Introduction to the RTL to GDSII Flow & Tool Setup
Week 1: Exploring the RISC-V ISA and Toolchain
Week 2: Verilog RTL Design for a RISC-V Core
(More weeks to be added as the program progresses)
Acknowledgements üôè
A huge thank you to Kunal Ghosh and the entire VSD team for creating and conducting this invaluable program. Their guidance and expertise are instrumental in learning the complexities of VLSI and SoC design.
